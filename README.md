The following is taken from the Google Codelab https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/community/en/flowers_tf_lite.ipynb

The steps in the tutorial apply to flower photos. However we will apply the retraining on our own rubbish dataset.
I found this dataset https://github.com/garythung/trashnet/blob/master/data/dataset-resized.zip but it's for different types of recycling.
We can use this as demo for the hackathon and explain we need a different dataset.

Work is done in the Jupyter notebook.
